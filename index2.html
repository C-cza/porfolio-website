              <p class="card-sub">Technology Timeline Infographics</p>
              <p class="card-info">A Technology Timeline Infographic about the Vacuum Tube Era can show how technology evolved during the early 1900s to the mid-1900s. Vacuum tubes were the main technology used in radios, early computers, and televisions. They worked by controlling electric currents, making it possible to send signals and process data. This era was important because it laid the foundation for modern electronics, even though vacuum tubes were big, fragile, and used a lot of energy. They were later replaced by smaller, faster, and more efficient transistors in the 1950s.</p>

            <p class="card-info1">The "I Love You" virus was a famous cybercrime in the year 2000. It was a computer virus disguised as a love letter sent through email. When people opened the email attachment, the virus spread to their computer and damaged files. It also sent itself to everyone in the victim’s email contacts. This caused millions of computers worldwide to get infected, leading to big losses for companies and individuals. The "I Love You" virus showed how dangerous cybercrime can be and why it’s important to stay cautious online.</p>

          <p class="card-sub2">HTML and CSS Activity</p>
          <p class="card-info2">HTML and CSS are tools used to create websites. HTML is like the structure of a house—it organizes the content, such as text, images, and links. CSS is like the decorations—it makes the website look nice by adding colors, styles, and layouts. For practice, you can create a simple webpage with HTML by writing a heading, a paragraph, and adding an image. Then, use CSS to change the text color, make the image bigger or smaller, and add a background color. It's fun and helps you learn how websites work!</p>

        <p class="card-sub3">Wireframe Creation for Portfolio Website</p>
        <p class="card-info3">Creating a wireframe for a portfolio website is a great first step in building your site. A wireframe is like a blueprint that shows how your website will look and work. It helps you plan where everything will go before you start designing. <br>

          To start, think about the main sections you want on your website, like your homepage, projects, about me, and contact information. Use simple shapes and lines to sketch out where each section will be. You don’t need to worry about colors or images yet; just focus on the layout.</p>

        <p class="card-sub4">Cross Analysis on Technology Trends</p>
        <p class="card-info4">Cross analysis of technology trends like AI, cloud computing, and IoT helps us understand how these areas work together. AI, or artificial intelligence, is about making machines smart so they can learn and make decisions. Cloud computing lets us store and access data over the internet, making it easier to share information. IoT, or the Internet of Things, connects everyday devices to the internet, allowing them to communicate and gather data. <br>
          By looking at these trends together, we can see how they support each other. For example, AI can analyze data from IoT devices stored in the cloud, helping us make better decisions. Understanding this connection helps businesses and individuals use technology more effectively. Even though it can be complex, exploring these trends is exciting, and it shows us how technology shapes our world.</p>

      <p class="card-sub5">Animation</p>
      <p class="card-info5">Animating in Krita can be tough, but I really enjoy it. At first, figuring out the tools and how to make things move takes time. You have to learn about layers, frames, and timing. Sometimes it feels frustrating when things don’t look right. But when everything comes together, it feels amazing to see your drawings come to life. The challenges make me better, and each project teaches me something new. In the end, the fun of creating something unique makes it all worth it!</p>
